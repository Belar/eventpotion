## What to do with it?  

It's an MVP, code isn't perfect (I managed to recover only some dev files and production side), but it covers a few problems that often are left with none or very little explanation on forums/SO/Reddit.  

If you would like to read more about time zones, here is [an article](https://belardesign.com/2014/01/09/laravel-the-timemaster-time-convertions-with-datetime-php/).  

## Support  
This repo is in no way a maintained product. I provide it in "as-is" state, for pure educational purposes. Today (2015), I would build it in a different way, with different tools.
